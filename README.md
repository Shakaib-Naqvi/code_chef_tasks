## Task 1: Leap Year

### Topics covered: Boolean, Conditionals

Given a year check if its a leap year. Leap year in Georgian calendar occurs: 

- every year that is divisible by 4, except the one that is evenly divisible by 100 and not evenly divisible 400.

example 1993 is not a leap year but 1992 is, 1900 is not a leap year but 2000 is.








## TASK 2: Political Slogans

### Topics: Conditionals, Maths, Prime, functions

The task is to identify which political statement belongs to which party leader using some rules based on the concept of factors and prime numbers in mathematics. 
The rules of tagging are:

- If 3 is a factor of a number, add Men inko Rulaonga to the result.
- If 5 is a factor of a number, add Mujhe Kion Nikala to the result.
- If 7 is a factor of a number, add Barish hoti he toh Paani ata he to the result.
- If the number is prime, add Tabdeeli agai he to the result.
- If it does not have 3,5,7 as a factor and is not prime, print the number instead.

Examples:
- 56 has 7 as a factor, but not 3 or 5, the result shows Barish hotihe toh Paani ata he.
- 30 has both 3 and 5 as factors, but not 7, the result would be Men inko Rulaonga Mujhe Kion Nikala.
- 34 does not belong to any party.


## Task 3: Some Simple Math

### Topics: simple math

Ek dafa ka zikar he Pakistan kay wazir e azam kay betay ki ek doctor ne jaan bacahi, wazir e azam ne kaha iskay badaly jo khuwahish he poori ki jayegi. Kion kay doctor ko pata tha wazi e azam unparh hen or ludo kay ilawa inhe kuch nai ata to doctor ne ek ajeeb khuwasih ka izhar kia. Sony kay sikkay or ludo kay her chakor per sony kay sikkon ki tadaad dugni honi chahye.

Ludo board kay total 92 khanay hoty hen, apka task yeh he kay bataen konsay khanay men kitnay sonay kay sikkay ayengae or poore ludo ke kitne sony kay sikkay banengy.


## Task 4: Beer bottles

### Topics: ???? ü§êü§êü§ê

Let's try to work on a famous fun programming problem based on the popular 99 bottles of the beer song. I would urge you to try it on your own before referring to other online solutions. 

You have to write code that sings or generates the song with minimum lines of codes.

Note: submission is Monday next week 25th/may/2020

Song: 
99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.
Take one down and pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.

98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer.
Take one down and pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall.
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶...
3 bottles of beer on the wall, 3 bottles of beer.
Take one down and pass it around, 2 bottles of beer on the wall.

2 bottles of beer on the wall, 2 bottles of beer.
Take one down and pass it around, 1 bottle of beer on the wall.

1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.
Take it down and pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall.

No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer.
Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.


## Task 5: Fun with math and strings

### Topics: Conditional, Loops, math

Given an input find the list of all the prime factors and check if the given number is an Armstrong number.

Our previous task was on Prime numbers and factors so I don't need to explain the concepts.
Armstrong number is a number which is equal to the sum of its digits raised to the power of total digits. For eg. 9 = 9 ^ 1(armstrong number), 27 = 2^2 + 7 ^ 2(not an armstrong number), 371 = 3 ^ 3, 7 ^ 3, 1 ^3 = 371 (armstrong number) and so on..


## Task - 6: Pascals Triangle in Rust

### Topics: math, structs, vectors, functions

Your task is to create a pascals triangle up to a given number of rows given by the user. 
Pascal's triangle is named after the 17th century's great French mathematician, Blaise Pascal. it is computed by summing adjacent elements in preceding rows in other words adding the numbers to the right and left of the current position in the previous row.


## Task-7: When to take Medicine

You are prescribed by your doctor to take medicine every alternate day starting from a specific date. You being a logical person came up with an idea of ü§î taking pills on the dates which are even or odd instead remembering the last day you took the medicine, messing up the dates and taking drugs on the wrong days.

with your code find out if there is something wrong with your logic and the number of days you took the medicine on time before messing up.

you will need to write a program that takes starting date as input :)

### Hint: you can reuse your leap year logic here too :)
